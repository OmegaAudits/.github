# Team Omega | Senior Smart Contract Security

**Direct Expertise. Institutional Scale. Hacker-Proven Intelligence**

Team Omega is a boutique security partnership composed of two senior Solidity experts: Jelle (PhD in Logic) and Ben. 
We provide deep, line-by-line manual reviews of smart contract architecture and Web3-related code, without the use of junior staff, interns, or administrative handoffs

## Core Expertise & Experience

Active in the Ethereum ecosystem since 2016, we specialize in the security of high-complexity protocols where logic errors carry catastrophic financial risk.

* Bridges & Interoperability: Securing the core infrastructure for cross-chain value transfer.
* Lending & Liquidity: Auditing modular vault kits and complex interest-rate logic.
* RWA & Tokenization: Verifying the integrity of institutional real-world asset protocols.
* Governance & Staking: Securing DAO treasuries and multi-tier incentive systems.
* Agent automization: Security audits of backend logic in Python and NodeJs. 
  

## Institutional Track Record

Contracts audited by Team Omega have cumulatively managed and protected hundreds of millions of Dollar value in TVL. 
We serve as a trusted security partner for the industry’s most critical infrastructure, including:
* Gnosis: Security reviews for the Gnosis Bridge and the Hashi cross-chain protocol.   
* Euler Finance: Technical analysis and rigorous auditing of the modular Euler V2 architecture.
* Backed Finance: Primary security oversight for the leading RWA tokenization framework.

## Hacker mindset 

For the last four years, we have led the development and security strategy for Hats Finance, a leading decentralized bug bounty protocol.
This role provides us with a unique vantage point:
* The Hacker Mindset: By judging real-world dispute cases and managing hundreds of bug bounties, we have an exhaustive internal database of how attackers identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
* Industry Benchmarking: Working alongside hundreds of independent auditors and security firms has given us unparalleled insight into global code quality and current exploit patterns.
* Architectural Guidance: We leverage this data to mentor teams, helping them elevate their code-writing standards to be resilient against modern attack vectors.

## The Boutique Difference
Our model is built on Seniority and Value. Unlike larger firms, you work directly with Jelle and Ben from the initial scoping call to the final report.
* Direct Developer-to-Auditor Communication: No technical details are lost in translation through project managers.
* Efficient Overhead: Our lean structure eliminates agency markups, ensuring your budget is spent exclusively on high-tier engineering review.
* Cost-Effective Rigor: We provide a competitive alternative to "Big Four" audit firms without sacrificing the technical depth required for institutional-grade protocols.
